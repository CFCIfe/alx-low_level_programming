### 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This project focuses on variables, conditionals (if-else statements), and loops (while and for loops).

#### Project Structure

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: A C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: A C program that prints whether the last digit of a randomly generated number is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a `while` loop.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase using `while` and `for` loops.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters "q" and "e", using a `while` loop.
- `5-print_numbers.c`: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using a `for` loop.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using only the `putchar` function and a `for` loop.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase letters, using a `for` loop.
- `8-print_base16.c`: A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using a `for` loop.
- `9-print_comb.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using nested `for` loops.
- `10-print_comb2.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using nested `for` loops.

#### Getting Started

To compile and run the programs in this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x01-variables_if_else_while` directory.
2. Use a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) to compile the desired C file. For example, to compile `0-positive_or_negative.c`, run the command: `gcc -o positive_or_negative 0-positive_or_negative.c`.
3. Execute the compiled program by running the generated executable. For example, run `./positive_or_negative` to execute `0-positive_or_negative.c`.
