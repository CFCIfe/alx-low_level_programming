### 0x08-recursion

This project dives into the concept of recursion and recursive functions.

#### Project Structure

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: A function that prints a string using recursion.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: A function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: A function that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- `3-factorial.c`: A function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: A function that calculates the value of a number raised to a power using recursion.
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: A function that calculates the square root of a number using recursion.
- `6-is_prime_number.c`: A function that checks if a number is a prime number using recursion.
- `7-is_palindrome.c`: A function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

#### Getting Started

To compile and run the programs in this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x08-recursion` directory.
2. Use a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) to compile the desired C file. For example, to compile `0-puts_recursion.c`, run the command: `gcc -o puts_recursion 0-puts_recursion.c`.
3. Execute the compiled program by running the generated executable. For example, run `./puts_recursion` to execute `0-puts_recursion.c`.

Feel free to explore and run the programs in each project to learn and understand the concepts covered in the ALX Software Engineering Course.
