# My First C Programming Project

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Course and serves as my first attempt in learning the C programming language.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to gain a foundational understanding of C programming by implementing various exercises and tasks assigned throughout the course.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple directories, each containing a set of related C programming tasks. The directory structure is as follows:

- `0x00-hello_world`: Contains introductory tasks and exercises for getting started with C programming.
- `0x01-variables_if_else_while`: Focuses on variables, conditionals (if-else statements), and loops (while and for loops).
- `0x02-functions_nested_loops`: Explores the concept of functions and nested loops in C programming.
- `0x03-debugging`: Covers debugging techniques and practices.
- `0x04-more_functions_nested_loops`: Expands on the knowledge of functions and nested loops.
- `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings`: Introduces pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.
- `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings`: Continues with pointers, arrays, and strings, building on the previous directory.
- `0x07-pointers_arrays_strings`: Further explores pointers, arrays, and strings.
- `0x08-recursion`: Dives into the concept of recursion and recursive functions.
- `0x09-static_libraries`: Covers the creation and usage of static libraries in C programming.
- `0x0A-argc_argv`: Focuses on command line arguments (argc and argv) in C programming.
- `0x0B-malloc_free`: Introduces dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using malloc and free functions.
- `0x0C-more_malloc_free`: Continues with dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
- `0x0D-preprocessor`: Covers the preprocessor directives and macros in C programming.
- `0x0E-structures_typedef`: Explores structures and typedef in C programming.
- `0x0F-function_pointers`: Focuses on function pointers and their usage.
- `0x10-variadic_functions`: Introduces variadic functions in C programming.
- `0x11-singly_linked_lists`: Covers the implementation of singly linked lists.
- `0x12-more_singly_linked_lists`: Continues with the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists.
- `0x13-bit_manipulation`: Explores bit manipulation techniques in C programming.
- `0x14-file_io`: Covers file input/output operations in C programming.
- `0x15-simple_shell`: Implements a simple UNIX shell using C programming.

## Getting Started

To explore the projects and tasks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired directory containing the project/task you want to explore.
3. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
4. Run the compiled executable to execute the program and observe the output.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are not applicable as it is part of my personal learning journey. However, feel free to explore the code, provide suggestions, or use it as a reference for your own projects.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, I aim to gain a solid foundation in C programming and enhance my skills in software engineering. This project serves as the starting point for further exploration of the C language and its various applications.

Let's dive into the world of C programming together!
