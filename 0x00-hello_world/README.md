### 0x00-hello_world

This project contains introductory tasks and exercises for getting started with C programming.

#### Project Structure

- `0-hello_world.c`: A simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `1-puts.c`: A C program that uses the `puts` function to print a string to the console.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a loop.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase using loops.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters "q" and "e".
- `5-print_numbers.c`: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using only the `putchar` function.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase letters.
- `8-print_base16.c`: A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- `9-print_comb.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- `10-print_comb2.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers.

#### Getting Started

To compile and run the programs in this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x00-hello_world` directory.
2. Use a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) to compile the desired C file. For example, to compile `0-hello_world.c`, run the command: `gcc -o hello_world 0-hello_world.c`.
3. Execute the compiled program by running the generated executable. For example, run `./hello_world` to execute `0-hello_world.c`.
